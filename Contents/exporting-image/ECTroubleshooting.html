  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Before trying the examples from our download package, you need to undertake the necessary setup steps as under:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When running the Server-side examples, make sure that you have copied-pasted the relevant Export Handlers (Server-side) to your server. Next, in each example XML, provide the path to that handler and then try again.</li>
        <li>When running Client-side examples, make sure that you've copied-pasted the examples (along with ../FusionCharts folder) to your server (either localhost or remote). The reason why they will not work on local files system is that Adobe Flash Player blocks Flash to JavaScript communication on local file system for security reasons, which FusionCharts XT uses for Client-side exporting. If you need to over-ride that for a specific folder, you will need to visit <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flash player/help/settings_manager04.html</a> and then in that interface add the folder containing our examples to the list of allowed folder. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>If it still does not work, switch the debug mode of chart to on and it will be able to guide as to what might be wrong. </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>This cannot be done. FusionCharts XT necessarily needs to render once in the browser, before any of the Export Handlers are called. This is because the charts are always generated at Client-side. After that, it takes a snapshot to the Client-side Export Component or Server-side Export scripts for generation of image/PDFs. </p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Make sure of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have Flash Player 10 installed. FusionCharts Export Component has been coded in Flash CS4 and needs Adobe Flash Player 10 to run. </li>
        <li>You have included <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportComponent.js</span> in your page (after <span class="codeInline">FusionCharts.js</span>)  </li>
        <li>The constructor of <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportObject</span> correctly specified the path to <span class="codeInline">FCExporter.swf</span> </li>
        <li>The DIV which yo ha've specified in <span class="codeInline">Render(divId)</span> call actually exists. </li>
        <li>The JavaScript code that you've written to initialize the Export Component does not have any bugs</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If nothing works, switch the <span class="codeInline">debugMode</span> of component to true (<a href="ECReferenceDebugJS.html">click here for details</a>), and it will show what went wrong. </p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="header">Instead of saving on server, can I directly e-mail the chart? </td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Currently, the only way will be to use a print PDF driver (like say PDF995). Since FusionCharts Export Component does not have access to anything that is contained in your browser window, it cannot export that as a PDF. </p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>The PDFs rendered by FusionCharts Export Handler is 72 DPI in PDF. The PDF viewer that you are using must have been set to a different Display Resolution (pixel/inch setting). A higher value will show the chart bigger and blurred while a smaller value will reduce the chart size. Please set the Resolution to 72 to see the correct chart size.</p></td>
