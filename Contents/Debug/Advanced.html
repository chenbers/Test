Many browsers restrict JavaScript from accessing local file system owing to security reasons. The JavaScript charts, when running locally, will not be able to access data provided as a URL. If you run the files from a server, it will run absolutely fine, as the   data is then read and streamed by the server, without the need for   JavaScript to directly access local file system. When running locally, however, if you provide the data as string (using the <a href="../guide-for-web-developers/how-fusioncharts-works/DataXMLExp.html">Data String</a> method), it works fine. </p>    </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>Please note that in order to use any multi-lingual characters on the chart, you necessarily need to use UTF-8 encoded XML/JSON. More importantly, the XML/JSON file or stream requires UTF-8 BOM stamp to be present as the very first 3 Bytes of the file. Most of the text editors like Notepad can do this automatically. To know more on how to BOM mark a file, please read Using <a href="../advanced/special-chars/SpChar.html">Multi-lingual text</a> page in <strong>Advanced Charting &gt; Using special characters</strong> section. </p>
    <p>Please note the two basic thumb rules: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> For <a href="../guide-for-web-developers/how-fusioncharts-works/DataURL.html">Data URL</a> method - the XML/JSON should be having the BOM stamp</li>
      <li>For <a href="../guide-for-web-developers/how-fusioncharts-works/DataXMLExp.html">Data String</a> method - the HTML/application file containing the XML/JSON should have the BOM stamp. </li>
      </ul>
    <p class="highlightBlock">BOM is Byte Order Mark. It is 'EF BB EF' - these 3 bytes in case of UTF-8 encoded files, the BOM being placed at the very beginning of the file. It is an indicator that the file is containing UTF-8 encoded strings. Also, please note that specifying the encoding setting that is, <span class="codeInline">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span> in the XML header region does not add the Byte Order Mark (BOM) to the XML/JSON file. </p>
    <p> However, please note that FusionCharts XT supports only left-to-right languages, as of now. It does not have native support for right-to-left languages like Hebrew. So, if you want to use Hebrew with FusionCharts XT, you will have to programmatically reverse the sequence of words or characters and then provide the same to FusionCharts XT.</p></td>
