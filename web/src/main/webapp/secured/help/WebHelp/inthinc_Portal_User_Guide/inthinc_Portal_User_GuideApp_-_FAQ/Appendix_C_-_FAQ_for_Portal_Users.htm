<p class="Title">Appendix C - <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>FAQ for Portal Users</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">Review the following list of frequently asked questions to help you better understand <span class="Bold">tiwiPro™ Portal</span><span class="Bold"></span> system.</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Does the tiwi™ turn on with the vehicle's ignition? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">No. The tiwi™ turns on with a wiggle sensor and it is not directly attached to the vehicle's ignition. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">What is AGPS? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">AGPS stands for Assisted GPS, which just means that we download ephemeris data from all the GPS satellites instead of just the satellites in view. This is usually available within 30 seconds of powering the TiwiPro. AGPS allows the device to maintain lock with a much weaker GPS signal, which can be caused by vertical windshields, urban canyons, real canyons, thick tree cover, etc... </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why can't a driver login with their RFID card? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">The tiwiPro's RFID range is very limited. As long as the card is placed in the correct location it will usually work correctly. Troubleshooting content has been taken from the following location and added to the new In-Cab User Guide: https://svn.iwiglobal.com/wiki/index.php/RFID_Card </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">After how much driving time is a no driver notification sent? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">A: The no driver violation is sent once the vehicle has moved 250 ft if the vehicle is traveling greater than 3 mph. There isn't a time aspect to this violation. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Is a vertical of nearly 2 g's really possible? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">The hard vertical is a peak-to-peak value, so when the accelerometer swings from -0.9g to +0.9g it would send 1.8g's to the portal. This is also a high frequency event, so it is not like turns/brakes/accels where we filter out the high frequency peaks. On some vehicles, depending on mounting locations we have seen upwards of 3 g's peak to peak. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">The Manager wants to receive text messages instead of emails or phone calls. How do I set this up? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">Most cell phone providers in the United States provide an email gateway for SMS messages. Each provider is dif&#173;ferent, but we have a list of most providers in the tiwiPro User Manual. For example if you have a Manager on an AT&amp;T with the phone number 801-555-1212, you would enter 8015551212@txt.att.net to send a text mes&#173;sage. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why is it important to have drivers assigned to vehicles? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">Without a driver assignment the driver score will get assigned to the &quot;unknown&quot; driver. In this case the driver is getting a free pass on driving violations. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Can I get email/text/phone alerts when a driver is speeding? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">Yes. Check out the red flags section under the Admin area of the portal. We can send alerts on speeding, driving style, seat belt usage, crashes, tampering, low vehicle battery and no driver logged in. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Can I create different zones for different groups under the same customer account? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">No. Currently all of the zones are applied to every vehicle under that customer's account. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why doesn't my trip start where the vehicle started? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">We don't start the trip until we have acquired a good GPS location. If it takes 30 seconds to acquire a good lock after powering on, then that portion of the trip will not show up on the portal. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why are my trips on the portal cutting corners? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">The TiwiPro sends location updates every 15 seconds. The portal just draws a straight line between these two points. In many cases this will cut corners. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why is there a big straight section on my trip? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">This is almost always caused by loss of GPS lock, or poor quality lock. If this is happening often with a specific vehicle then this unit should be looked at for a possible RMA. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why does my score change from a 1.0 to a 5.0 in a single day? This change seems to happen too fast. </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">The score is based on the last 7 days of driving, so if you have an event, or multiple events, that happended 8 days prior those will all get dropped. Basically, on the 8th day those events are not weighted in the score in any way. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Many speeding events have a speed lower than the posted speed. How is this possible? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">Speeding violations are always sent at the end of the violation, so speed &lt; speed limit + [buffer] is normal. The case where speed > speed limit + buffer would be created when the speed limit changes since we start a new speeding violation in this case. Whenever we look at speeding use the topSpeed value to determine the top speed during the entire speeding violation. &lt;/nowiki> </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">There are speeding events where the speed is 0mph. How is this possible? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">This would be caused by the speed suddenly dropping out - the usual case here is running without an EMU and loss of GPS lock. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Why are there so many hard bumps on freeways? </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">Hard bump thresholds need to be made less sensitive for this vehicle. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Many aggressive driving events exist with speeds of 0mph. Many others are also associated with speeds less than 10mph, which seems difficult to achieve and believe. </span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">This is the same as speeding, so it is sending the speed after the violation has finished. A speed of 0 is almost expected for hard brakes, turns are a little harder to believe. You could also get a 0 speed if you are not run&#173;ning with an EMU and you lose GPS lock. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">You log a driver into a TiwiPro via the RFID reader or the portal. &nbsp;A new login replaces the previous driver. &nbsp;You cannot log out of a TiwiPro.</span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">If you move a driver from one team to the other, that driver's history will stay with the first team and remain calculated into that team's score. &nbsp;Any new driving history will affect the new team's score.</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Can I turn off Speeding Mentoring?</span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">No, but you can increase the speeding threshold. &nbsp;Mentoring starts at 1 mph greater than the speeding thresh&#173;old. &nbsp;Grace period for a violation is 15 seconds. The mentoring audio will play (in seconds) at 3, 13, 23, 33, 63, 93, 123, and so on.</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Can I turn off Seat Belt Mentoring?</span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">No. &nbsp;Seat belt mentoring starts at over 10 mph. &nbsp;The grace period for a violation is 10 seconds.</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">How do I increase or decrease sensitivity for the Hard Accelerate, Hard Brake, Hard Turn, or Hard Bump, parameters?</span></p>
 <p class="FM_StepLev2first">a.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>On the Admin page, choose Vehicle or Device option (left menu).</p>
 <p class="FM_StepLev2">b.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Click a Vehicle or Device ID hotlink.</p>
 <p class="FM_StepLev2">c.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>On the dialog page, click Edit (upper-right).</p>
 <p class="FM_StepLev2">d.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Go to Speed &amp; Sensitivity tab.</p>
 <p class="FM_StepLev2">e.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>In the Sensitivity section, move slider to increase or decrease the sensitivity setting</p>
 <p class="FM_StepLev2">f.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Click Save (upper-right).</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="margin-bottom : 4.000pt; font-style : italic;"><span class="Emphasis">Can I configure Trip Start or Trip Continuation?</span></p>
 <p class="BodyLevel3">No. A new Trip Start is created when the vehicle moves 250 feet or reaches 10 mph. Moving from one parking place to another does not constitute a trip. If a Trip Start is received within 5 minutes of the previous Trip End, the portal will consider it one trip.</p>
