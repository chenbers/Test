 <p class="BodyLevel1">This Limited Warranty is offered by inthinc, inc. (“inthinc”) for its tiwi™ driver mentoring/vehicle monitoring systems.</p>
 <h4>What this Limited Warranty Covers</h4>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">This Limited Warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use of a tiwi™ in-cab device (the “Device”) for a period of one (1) year from the date of purchase, or until such date as purchaser breaches (without proper cure) any agreement with inthinc, whichever is the shorter (the “Warranty Period”). inthinc, at its sole discre&#173;tion, will repair the Device or will replace the Device with a new or refurbished unit (a “Replacement Device”). Devices replaced under this Limited Warranty become the property of inthinc. Replacement Devices are warranted to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for 90 days or the remainder of the Warranty Period, whichever is longer. </p>
 <h4>What this Limited Warranty does not cover<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></h4>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">This Limited Warranty does not cover defects or damage caused by accident, misuse, abuse, neglect, fire, water, other acts of nature, power surges, unauthorized or improper modifications or repairs, improper maintenance, usage not in accordance with the Device instructions or specifications, improper installation, or usage or storage in unsuitable physi&#173;cal or operating environments. This Limited Warranty does not cover damages or defects caused by local environmental conditions or that result from any failure in services provided by a third party (e.g. failure of the communications net&#173;work). Opening, dismantling or repairing of the Device by anyone other than an authorized inthinc representative or technician will void this Limited Warranty. </p>
 <h4>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are specifically excluded from cov&#173;erage under this Limited Warranty:</h4>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">1) periodic maintenance and repair or replacement of parts due to normal wear and tear;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">2) batteries;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">3) finishes or physical damage to the surface of the Device;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">4) installations or defects resulting from installation;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">5) damage caused by (i) shipping, misuse, abuse, negligence, tampering, moisture, liquids, proximity or exposure to heat, or improper use; (ii) disasters such as fire, flood, wind, and lightning; (iii) unauthorized attachments or modifica&#173;tions to the Device;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">6) service performed or attempted by anyone other than an authorized inthinc service provider; and</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">7) any product, components or parts not manufactured by inthinc.</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1" style="font-weight : bold;">LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">THE DEVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS”. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. INTHINC HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE LIM&#173;ITED IN DURATION TO THE PERIOD OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">REMEDIES UNDER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY ARE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT, AT THE OPTION OF INTHINC. INTHINC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO PURCHASER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CON&#173;SEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM DELAY OR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, BREACH OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR ANY IMPLIED WAR&#173;RANTY EVEN THOUGH CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OF INTHINC OR NEGLIGENT USAGE OF THE PRODUCT. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF INTHINC SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE DEVICE. </p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">This Limited Warranty is not transferable.</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="BodyLevel1">Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply. This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights which may vary from state to state.<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:7.0pt"><font size=1 style="font-size:7pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
