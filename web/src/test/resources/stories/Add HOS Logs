Narrative:

In order to update daily driver logs  
As HOS Manager
I need to be able to manually add, edit, and delete logs from the HOS logs for HOS specific drivers

Scenario: Add logName
Given I am on the HOS Driver Logs page
When I enter a logged in valid driver name
And I select the closet match to my driver name
And I select a valid date range
And I click on the "Refresh" button
And I click on the "Add" button
When the Add HOS Log page opens
And I select a date with no logs
And I enter a time frame
And I select a "<logName>" from the dropdown
And I enter an eight character "trailerId"
And I enter an eight character "serviceNumber"
And I select my current driverName from the dropdown
And I select a "vehicleID" from the dropdown
And I enter a "cityName" and "stateName" in the location field
And I select a "DOTStatus" from the dropdown
And I click on "Save" button
When I am back on the Driver Logs page for my chosen driver
And I click on the "Send HOS Logs to Device" envelope button
And a "message" displays 
Then I verify that the details of the HOS Logs have been received by the waysmart
